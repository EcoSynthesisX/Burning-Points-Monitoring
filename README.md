### Total Labor Costs
- **Total**: $15,300 for a 3-month project.

## Operational Guidelines

### Flight Operations
- Conduct daily flights around 7 pm to capture backyard burning activities.
- Maintain detailed logs for each flight, documenting the date, time, and observations.

### Video Processing and Mapping
- Compile weekly video summaries showing heat signatures and locations.
- Utilize GIS software to overlay burning locations on a neighborhood map.

### Community Engagement
- Share findings with local authorities and the community to raise awareness.
- Focus on educational approaches to address unsafe burning practices.

### Privacy and Legal Compliance
- Ensure all operations comply with local drone regulations and privacy laws.
- Engage with the community respectfully, prioritizing education over enforcement.

## Summary
The project utilizes advanced drone and infrared imaging technology to monitor backyard burning practices, providing valuable data for community safety and environmental monitoring. Detailed planning, including cost estimates for equipment, software, and labor, ensures effective budgeting and execution. The project emphasizes legal compliance, privacy considerations, and constructive community engagement, aiming to enhance fire safety awareness and practices.
